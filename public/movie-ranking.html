    <li><h2>Meet Joe Black (1998)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Genre: Drama, Romance</li>
            <li>Director: Martin Brest</li>
            <li>Why it’s the best: This one is an emotional rollercoaster! The movie brings together life, death, and love in a unique way, with Brad Pitt playing Joe Black, the personification of death. The soul-searching and reflection on life’s meaning are so deep, and the performances are unforgettable, especially Anthony Hopkins. It’s one of those films that hits you hard in the heart. 💔

A group of "extractors" dive into people’s dreams to steal secrets, but what happens when they have to plant an idea instead? It’s a perfect blend of action, suspense, and mind-bending concepts that will have you questioning what’s real. If you haven't seen it yet, get ready to have your brain rearranged! 🧠💥
